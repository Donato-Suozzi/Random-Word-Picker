# A Random Word Generator


Yo, mate! Are you good?

Welcome to the serious version of my profile, unfortunately.

I don't know why are you here, but thanks for been here. :D

Returning to the project, it is a simple word generator which gives you the meaning of the word, picked from the dictionary, opening Urban Dictionary.

It's really simple, you press the button and it will open Urban Dictionary for this random word, I don't think it's too difficult.

I have to say it: It has a very bad design (I'm not good at it...).

Anyway, It is opened in Chrome in Incognito Mode (because why not?)

__IMPORTANT THING:__ The word are picked from the Dictionary, they are not randomly created!
